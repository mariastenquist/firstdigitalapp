step 2: after signing up for digital ocean, click: 'create droplet'
step 3: basic settings
step 4: Ubuntu, and MEAN 14. (choose an operating system)
5: check your email
6: login to our server with: ssh <username>@<ip address> then paste in info, change password
7: change the password when prompted
8: delete the sample app in opt/mean
9: clone your app onto the droplet
10: run npm install to grab dependencies
11: run npm install -g forever
12: start your app with 'forever start app.js' (or whatever the entry point is)

----better practices-----

after logging in the first time, create a new user account, and then disable the root user.

use SSH keys instead of passwords for making the SSH connection.

terminal tips:
when looged in via ssh, there's no graphical interface. use the command 'less' to read files. Press 'q' to exit less.

'nano' is an easy to use command-line text editor.
